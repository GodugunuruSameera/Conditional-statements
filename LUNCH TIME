CODE:
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int T = sc.nextInt();

        while (T-- > 0) {
            int X = sc.nextInt();

            if (X >= 1 && X <= 4)
                System.out.println("YES");
            else
                System.out.println("NO");
        }
    }
